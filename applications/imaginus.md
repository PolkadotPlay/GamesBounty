## Game Project Overview :page_facing_up:

# Game Project Application Form

## 1. Pitch the Game

### Please describe the game in a short pitch.
> **Imaginus** is a groundbreaking game that combines a classic 2D platformer with cutting-edge blockchain technology. Imagine jumping, solving puzzles, and battling enemies with a unique twist: the cool items you collect and the pets you team up with in the game can truly belong to you thanks to NFTs. Through blockchain, you can own your in-game achievements as digital collectibles. This means you can sell them or keep them as part of your digital collection.
The $IMA token will not only fuels the in-game economy but also empowers players and creators to contribute to the game’s ecosystem, fostering a vibrant community centered around continuous improvement and creative expression. By engaging in various contribution opportunities, community members can shape the future of the game while being fairly rewarded through a transparent and inclusive DAO-based system. Regular updates and structured governance ensure that player feedback and innovative ideas are seamlessly integrated, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving gaming experience.

### Please describe the game's core loop? (minimalistic)
> Single play loop: Explore (Action) -> Collect (Reward) -> Kill Enemy (Action) -> Find new magic (Reward) -> Solve puzzle (Action) -> Upgrade (Reward) -> Reward

### Are there any existing games that you would consider similar to your project?
> Our game offers a unique gameplay experience where players are not just participants but integral creators of its development. We provide diverse worlds spanning both Web2 and Web3 environments, allowing players to immerse themselves in a rich and varied gaming experience. The integration of blockchain technology enables ownership and trading of in-game items as NFTs, adding real-world value and deepening player engagement. Through a structured DAO system, our community contributes art, animations, sound design, magic spells, and arenas, all fairly rewarded based on impact and complexity. These elements, coupled with the ability to govern game development through $IMA tokens, make our game truly unique and incomparable to others in the market. 
Our product is pretty unique, but if you're looking for comparable games, there are only a few options similar to ours: Ori and the Blind Forest, Oddmar, and Gris

### Do you have a Game Design Document (GDD) for your project?
> Yes, we have a pitch deck, where you can see the design of our project & GDD is attached.

## 2. Game Dev Experience

### Have you built games prior to this bounty request?
> No, we haven’t built the grants related to games. 
However, one of the founders, Toma, has applied for and successfully obtained multiple grants, such as OpenBrush for the first year and the WebSummit proposal for Open Gov. Additionally, she was the facilitator of the inkubator, one of the first bounties in the Polkadot ecosystem..

### Do any of the previously mentioned games have a Web3 component?
> Our team had the experience to be part of the team, who are building the games and launch it successfully. such as Zula, Murka games, Last of Us, cosmic duck games - please check more here

### Do you have experience in working with game engines, such as Unity & Unreal?
> Yes, our team possesses extensive experience working with various gaming engines, particularly Unity 3D

## 3. Technical Expertise

### How much of your game logic do you intend to build on the blockchain?
- [ ] None, I just want a token.
- [ ] Only the Game Assets/NFTs should remain on-chain.
- [X] Some mechanics will need to be on-chain.
- [ ] This should be a fully on-chain game.
- [ ] Other: 

### Do you have any expertise in Blockchain Development?
- [ ] No, none at all.
- [ ] I know how the Blockchain works, but never developed anything in crypto.
- [X] I have EVM / SmartContract experience.
- [ ] I have only used SDK for my games on other platforms.
- [X] I know Rust & Substrate and can create basic runtime code.
- [ ] Other:

### Would you like a technical Team from Polkadot Play, to help you identify the technical requirements?
> Yes, we would greatly appreciate your advice on using the Unity Polkadot SDK, as we have no prior experience developing with it. Additionally, it's crucial for us to understand if there are any specific requirements for minting NFTs, launching, etc., since we plan to deploy the contracts on the Astar Network. Your guidance will be invaluable as we navigate these processes.

## 5. Development

### Development Status :open_book:
> We are currently developing a proof of concept for Android and iOS using our own resources. The prototype is about 50% complete. It features a single-player mode with one level, lasting approximately 20 seconds. This prototype is primarily designed to demonstrate the product to potential investors

### What are the key milestones for your game's development, and what are the estimated completion dates for each?
- **Milestone 1:** This Milestone is focused on design, animations, and pre-production work. it will take us 1.5 months to deliver!
- **Milestone 2:** This milestone is focused on development, Polkadot SDK Integration, and the web3 part. it will take us 2 months to deliver!

### Are you intending to raise more funds?
- Yes, we are currently in the pre-seed stage and actively raising additional funds. We have already secured a commitment from Polimec and are planning to launch it in the next few months. We are also fortunate to have support from the Astar team, which will be instrumental in our development and go-to-market strategies!! 
To fully finalize the product, we are estimating the need for an additional $900k, which will be allocated towards further development, marketing, and operational costs to ensure a robust market entry
