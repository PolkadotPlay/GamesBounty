## Game Project Overview :page_facing_up:

# Game Project Application Form

## 1. Pitch the Game

### Please describe the game in a short pitch.
"Demon Ranch" introduces players to a captivating tower defense experience, where Pokémon-like creatures known as Demons serve as formidable defense units safeguarding the base. While the journey of collecting and enhancing these creatures adheres to established tower defense game mechanics, the true essence of Demon Ranch lies in its innovative breeding system, promising uniquely rewarding outcomes. These monsters, represented as tokens, offer players a dynamic marketplace where they can engage in thrilling trades with fellow players or cater exclusively to collectors. Inspired by the allure of collectible card games, this feature serves as the heart and soul of Demon Ranch, promising an exhilarating adventure filled with strategic depth and boundless possibilities.

### Please describe the game's core loop? (minimalistic)
__Planning__ Phase -> __Action__ Phase (tower defence) -> __Breed__ (generate monsters) -> __Customize__ Base

### Are there any existing games that you would consider similar to your project?

The tower defense genre is very popular in the game market, with many examples in the on-chain market such as [Plants vs. Undead](https://plantvsundead.com/), [Crazy Defence Heroes](https://crazydefenseheroes.com/) and [Rise of Cats](https://play.catecoin.club/). However, none of these are fully mobile compatible nor are they similar in scope to our project. We aim to provide a simple, fair and an original experience.

### Do you have a Game Design Document (GDD) for your project?
To create a thorough document, initial funding is necessary. In the meantime, we offer a basic design concept one-pager for a brief preview below.

## 2. Game Dev Experience

### Have you built games prior to this bounty request?
Before embarking on our commercial ventures and working with each other in our professional life, we honed our skills and creativity through numerous non-commercial projects in game jams. These events allowed us to experiment, innovate, and collaborate, fostering a strong foundation and passion that drives our current efforts. While we may not yet be seasoned professionals, we are eager to gain more experience in the field. Our enthusiasm and dedication drive us to continuously learn and improve as we take on new challenges.

### Do any of the previously mentioned games have a Web3 component?
Sadly, no.

### Do you have experience in working with game engines, such as Unity & Unreal?
As a team, we have also worked together at Phoca.io, developing various mobile titles such as: [Combat Blitz](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/combat-blitz/id6498898924), [Your Virtual Baby](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/your-virtual-baby/id1663782255), [Rat Hunter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rat-hunter/id6476625924), [Throw On Time](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1027857227517792256/1232970058322673664), [Affair Match](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/affair-match/id6473894918).
