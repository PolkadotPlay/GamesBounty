## Game Project Overview :page_facing_up:

# Game Project Application Form

## 1. Pitch the Game

### Please describe the game in a short pitch.
Capstone Earth is an interactive serious game about protecting the habitats of the world's rich biodiversity. It uses the latest technology to make nature a conscious experience and to impart knowledge in a playful way through in-game challenges. Players can join a community of like-minded individuals to actively conserve nature and combat climate change, and are incentivized with NFT game item rewards - a true gamification of conservation and experience. Blockchain gives us valuable tools to incentivize people to protect nature. The goal of the project is to create a gamified framework or scaffolding that will help people see the true value of nature and thus preserve it.

### Please describe the game's core loop? (minimalistic)
In-game build/farming & validate IRL habitat & solve quests-> Game Items/Loot (Reward) -> Buy/Sell -> Upgrade

### Are there any existing games that you would consider similar to your project?
*If so, please list them and describe how your game compares or differs.*
Similar to "Pokémon Go" as an interactive AR mobile game, but with more IRL interaction with nature combined with a building/farming social game like "Animal Crossing", about nature conservation.

### Do you have a Game Design Document (GDD) for your project?
- **If yes,** *could you please share the link of the document with us?*
- **If no,** *could you provide an excerpt or summary that highlights key aspects of your game's design, mechanics, and vision?*
There is a paper based game concept and the game design will be developed in the next 3 months. Details can be shared if NDA is signed.

## 2. Game Dev Experience

### Have you built games prior to this bounty request?
- **If yes,** *please list game name(s) & links:*
No. The Capstone Earth team is made up of entrepreneurs from the esports/gaming industry, Web3/NFT, and researchers from biology and conservation, all of whom are passionate about video games. We're working with several teams from universities: 1) Department of Science and Technology Didactics of FHNW, Switzerland led by Dr. Julia Arnold and 2) Immersive Realities Research Lab of HSLU, Switzerland led by André Thomas. Mr. Thomas has more than 30 years of experience in game design, game development, interactive graphics techniques and CGI production and previously worked as Head of Graphics for EA Sports.

### Do any of the previously mentioned games have a Web3 component?
- **If yes,** *please describe the Web3 components, link reference & blockchain ecosystem:*
No

### Do you have experience in working with game engines, such as Unity & Unreal?
- **If yes,** *please include some insights:*
Yes. Built virtual spaces in Unreal Engine and Unity. Example: https://aex-1.com/lab

## 3. Technical Expertise

### How much of your game logic do you intend to build on the blockchain?
- [ ] None, I just want a token.
- [x] Only the Game Assets/NFTs should remain on-chain.
- [ ] Some mechanics will need to be on-chain.
- [ ] This should be a fully on-chain game.
- [x] Other: Gamer’s profile/identity (KYC, enabling cross-platforms) & in-game currency integration

### Do you have any expertise in Blockchain Development?
- [ ] No, none at all.
- [x] I know how the Blockchain works, but never developed anything in crypto.
- [x] I have EVM / SmartContract experience.
- [ ] I have only used SDK for my games on other platforms.
- [ ] I know Rust & Substrate and can create basic runtime code.
- [x] Other: Worked at GameDAO in the Polkadot ecosystem and on Web3 projects in other industries (DAO, finance, tokenization, NFT, crypto trading) 

### Would you like a technical Team from Polkadot Play, to help you identify the technical requirements?
- **If yes,** please describe what you consider your major pain points.
Yes, we would need support in setting up the game assets on the chain and a user friendly wallet integration.

## 4. The Team

### Could you share insights about team members who are essential to your project's success? Highlight their specific skill sets and contributions to the game development. 

#### Team member #1
**Fernando Studer** is a conservation biologist with a Master of Science in Ecology from the University of Basel in Switzerland. He is also an educator with two degrees that qualify him to teach biology on a high school level. Most recently, he worked as a conservation educator at the Zoological Garden in Basel where he learned about in Situ and ex Situ conservation efforts around the globe along with the hurdles these projects are facing. From an early age, Fernando grew up with analog and digital games, which to this day interest him. He is the mind behind and majority owner of a game culture bar in Basel named ManaBar GmbH and created a vast network within the game community of Switzerland called the “Round table of Game Culture”. Fernando wants to pursue his goal of transitioning from a consumer-role of games more into a creator role.  He brings the necessary biological knowledge and the underlying philosophy of a nature conservationist to successfully realize this project. It is his goal to actually create an impact for nature, in a way that future generations can consider fun.

#### Team member #2
""Yonghan Lee"" is an entrepreneur/manager and author/editor of the crypto book "Ignore at Your Own Risk: The New Decentralized World of Bitcoin and Blockchain". He holds a Master of Science in Communication Systems from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). Beside his passion for innovation and technology, he holds the PMP certification and has multidisciplinary skills from over 14 years experience in Financial Services in the field of Digital Assets & Blockchain, Digital Transformation in banking as well as Gaming/Esports. Worked as business development and product owner at GameDAO in the polkadot ecosystem. Experienced in managing and consulting various other ventures in Web3, Gaming and Esports, Yonghan turned Capstone Earth into a much bigger project than originally intended and brought in his project management skills, vast knowledge of the blockchain- and crypto space and his investor network. With his business-mind and strategic outlook he manages the progress of the project and ensures the continuous impact of Capstone Earth.

## 5. Development

### Development Status :open_book:
If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here.
The project started in 2022 and the business model as well as the game concept were further developed in the early-stage accelerator program of Zünder accelerator and were finalists in challenges such as the Greentech startup battle, the Swiss innovation challenge and the Swiss sustainability challenge. Initial funding of CHF 150k was secured in Q2 2024 to work on an MVP to be released in a staged milestone approach. However, code implementation hasn't started yet.


### What are the key milestones for your game's development, and what are the estimated completion dates for each?
- **Milestone 1:** Complete game design by Q3 2024
- **Milestone 2:** Complete MVP and test with 1000 high school students in Basel (LOI signed) by Q4 2024
- **Milestone 3:** NFT/token sale by Q1 2025
- **Milestone 4:** Game Beta version by Q2 2025
- **Milestone 5:** Game Release by Q3/Q4 2025

### Are you intending to raise more funds?
Funding for the game design phase has been secured and upon reaching milestone 1, funding for the MVP of the game (excluding the Web3 part) will be released. Additional funding of USD 1.5 million will be raised for Web3 integration, marketing, community building and completion of the game (the amount may be less depending on the token sale).

## 6. Detailed Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your game project is related to Substrate, Kusama, Polkadot, or a (System-)Parachain. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
